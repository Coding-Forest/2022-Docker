- `docker swarm init`: initailise the manager
  - `--advertise-addr <ip addr>`
- `docker swarm join-token manager`
- `docker node update --availability drain <node>`: Docker recommends dedicating
  manager nodes for management tasks only in the production environment.

- The `leader` sends out notifications informing them that it is continuing
  to assume the role of the leader.
- If, for some reason, the `leader` becomes unavailable, a re-election process initiates to select another `leader`.
- Every manager has its own copy of Raft database that stores the information
  about the entire cluster. These raft db should be all in sync.

Install docker

[Install using the repository](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

1.  Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

2.  Add Docker‚Äôs official GPG key:

        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg

        gpg: WARNING: unsafe ownership on homedir '/home/forest/.gnupg'

3.  Use the following command to set up the stable repository. To add the nightly or test repository, add the word nightly or test (or both) after the word stable in the commands below. Learn about nightly and test channels.

        echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
        $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

4.  Start the service and configure permission.

        sudo systemctl start docker
        sudo usermod -aG docker "${USER}"
        sudo newgrp docker

### üê≥Swarming starts here.

- Create a `swarm cluster`.
- Add `nodes` to the `swarm cluster` as `workers` and as `masters`.

<br>

### `Swarm Manager`

- `docker swarm init`
- `docker swarm init --advertise-addr`

      $ docker swarm init
      Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces (10.42.106.6 on eth0 and 172.25.0.93 on eth1) - specify one with --advertise-addr

The above happens because the current host has multiple interfaces and multiple IP addresses - it has two interfaces connected to two separate networks.

      $ docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.25.0.93
      Swarm initialized: current node (6039ej4zlaajd6rlc3w77l2cs) is now a manager.

      To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

          docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-06vz9ck0q0irqk48ztpn6k5l0p5r0ljo3zrxmlxt3unf3yfmv4-99x4msreqr1298icz6tlecd4h 172.25.0.93:2377

      To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

In the above, `docker` has successfully initialized a `swarm cluster` with this node as the master node.

After joining some workers, check out the `swarm nodes`.

        docker node ls
        ID                            HOSTNAME        STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
        p5hz0a0twkroz0b4f5fpgg3ik     caleston-lp10   Ready     Active                          20.10.12
        glp7924bmhvoquj4iwtk80wvd *   devapp01        Ready     Active         Leader           20.10.12

<br>

### `Worker node`

1.  Join the node to the `swarm`.

        docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-5uwo54exfrheiu2muli8exlk6yuud3uev3o11quaa6gh4977rj-7wzb3ohunkuoigutziu7wznzr 172.16.239.2:2377
        This node joined a swarm as a worker.

### Workernode troubleshoots

1.  From on the `worker node`, it's not possible to view the `cluster`.

        docker node ls
        Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Worker nodes can't be used to view or modify cluster state. Please run this command on a manager node or promote the current node to a manager.

2.  Cannot connect to the `swarm cluster`.

        Error response from daemon: rpc error: code = Unavailable desc = connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 172.16.239.187:2377: connect: connection refused"

### Quiz

1. How many nodes are there?

   $ docker node ls
   ID HOSTNAME STATUS AVAILABILITY MANAGER ENGINE VERSION  
   60rlc3ws \* forest-plane Ready Active Leader 19.03.15

<br>

2. Initialise a `single-node swarm`.

You run into this error when you initiailise `swarm` again on a host where `swarm` is already running.

    $ docker swarm init
    Error response from daemon: This node is already part of a swarm. Use "docker swarm leave" to leave this swarm and join another one.

Check out the status.

    $ docker node ls
    ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS                  ID           HOSTNAME       STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER  ENGINE VERSION
    60rlc3ws *   forest-plane   Ready     Active         Leader   19.03.15

Leave the current `swarm`.

- `docker swarm leave`
- `docker swarm leave --force`

      $ docker swarm leave
      Error response from daemon: You are attempting to leave the swarm on a node that is participating as a manager. Removing the last manager erases all current state of the swarm. Use `--force` to ignore this message.

      $ docker swarm leave --force
      Node left the swarm.

      $ docker node ls
      Error response from daemon: This node is not a swarm manager. Use "docker swarm init" or "docker swarm join" to connect this node to swarm and try again.

3.  Create a service with 3 `replicas`.

        $ docker service create --name simple-forest-app --replicas 3 -p 8083:8080 -e APP_COLOR=pink forest/forest-app
        m6kdgxgz8jdk1kdphux5z03ju
        overall progress: 3 out of 3 tasks
        1/3: running
        2/3: running
        3/3: running
        verify: Service converged

4.  Scale the `replicas`.

        $ docker service update simple-forest-app --replicas 4
        simple-forest-app
        overall progress: 4 out of 4 tasks
        1/4: running
        2/4: running
        3/4: running
        4/4: running
        verify: Service converged
